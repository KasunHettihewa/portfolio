Automatic liver tumor segmentation is a paramount important application for liver tumor diagnosis and treatment planning. However, it has become a highly challenging task due to the heterogeneity of the tumor shape and intensity variation.  In this project, we propose a novel network named Multi Attention Network (MANet) as a fusion of attention mechanisms to learn highlighting important features while suppressing irrelevant features for the tumor segmentation task. The proposed deep learning network has followed U-Net as the basic architecture. Moreover, the residual mechanism is implemented in the encoder. The developed deep learning architecture is trained and evaluated on the publicly available MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset and 3DIRCADb dataset under various evaluation metrics. The novel network demonstrated promising results compared to state-of-the-art methods with comparatively small parameter overhead.

This project investigates an automated solution for the ball-catching task using a static camera and an automatically controlled mechanical system. The robot system can catch a ball that comes towards the ball-catching plane. The robot accomplishes the ball-catching task with different success rates according to the trajectory type and speed of the ball. The thrown ball is visually tracked through a ball detection image processing algorithm. The 2D synchronized motion of the ball catcher is coordinated by the PID algorithm. Experimental results are conducted to evaluate the performance of the robot.
